                    I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice." The concept of Lorem Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. design jobs non-competitive. Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't.I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it.

                    That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10. That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10. I know words. I have the best words.

                    An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life. My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women...

                    I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things. Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good decision. I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice." The concept of Lorem Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. design jobs non-competitive. Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder text.
